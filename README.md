##Sentiment Analysis for Yelp

###This project aims to Analyze the sentiment of yelp reviews as positive or negative or neutral using natural language processing techniques.

####Setup and Dependencies
To reproduce the project, you need to have the following libraries installed:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
scikit-learn
nltk


#### Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a collection of 10000 reviews, containing a mixture of positive and negative sentiment. It can be found in the data folder, along with its description.


#### Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
The dataset was preprocessed using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to transform the text into a structured format that can be used for better Analysis. The preprocessing steps include removing stop words, stemming, lemmatization and converting the text to lowercase.

Then we used a Vader model called Sentiment Intensity Analyzer to asses the sentiment of the text sentences.
